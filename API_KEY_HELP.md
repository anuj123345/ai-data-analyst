## Solutions

### Option 1: Get a Valid Together AI API Key

**Steps:**
1. Visit https://api.together.ai/
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Go to Settings → API Keys
4. Click "Create new API key"
5. Copy the FULL key (should be much longer, typically 50+ characters)
6. Valid formats usually look like:
   - `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` or
   - Long alphanumeric string (64+ characters)

**Important:** Together AI keys are FREE to create but may require:
- Email verification
- Initial credits (sometimes given free on signup)

### Option 2: Use Alternative FREE LLM Providers

Since Together AI isn't working, here are FREE alternatives:

#### A. **Groq** (Recommended - Very Fast & Free)
- URL: https://console.groq.com/
- Models: Llama 3.1, Mixtral, Gemma
- Free tier: Very generous
- Speed: Extremely fast

#### B. **OpenRouter** (Multiple Models)
- URL: https://openrouter.ai/
- Access to many models
- Some free options available

#### C. **Hugging Face** (Free but slower)
- URL: https://huggingface.co/
- Completely free
- Many open-source models

### Option 3: Modify App to Use Different Provider

I can modify the app to use:
1. **Groq** - Fastest and easiest alternative
2. **OpenAI** - If you have credits
3. **Any other provider** you prefer
